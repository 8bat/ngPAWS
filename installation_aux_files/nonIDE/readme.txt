ENGLISH - SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS
=============================

1) Once you have decompressed the ngPAWS you will have a folder with two subfolders
2) In the folder "new_game_pack" edit the line starting by ngpaws_path= to reflect the path to the ngPAWS executables (ngpc and txtpaws).
3) Rename the file database.start.english as code.txp
4) Copy the folder new_game_pack content in some other folder every time you want to start a new game
5) Edit code.txp file to make changes in your game (the one in the copied folder, not the one in the new_game_pack folder)
6) Run ./compile.sh every time you want to compile ( create a new version of the game)
7) Open index.html to see changes.
