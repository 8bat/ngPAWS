ngPAWS authoring system
=======================

ngPAWS (pronunced n-g-paws) is an authoring system based on the Professional Adventure
Writing System, thus the name ngPAWS stands for "next generation PAWS". 

PAWS was an authoring system widely used in UK and Spain in the later 80s and early 90s,
being the version for Sinclair ZX Spectrum the most well known, though there have been 
version for CP/M (Amstrad CPC, PCW) and IBM PC. Also, there are several clones of PAW 
made in the 90s, 2000, and 2010s.

What makes ngPAWS different?
----------------------------
What makes ngPAWS different is it does not generate an executable file, but a website. 
In fact, it generates javascript code that can be run in any modern browser. So text
adventures (aka interactive fiction) made with ngPAWS can be run in any web server, or 
locally.

The compiler was developed first by Yokiyoki for his PAW clone "Paguaglús", it has been 
modified during the years by me (Carlos Sanchez) for the Superglus project and now
I have adapted it to generate javascript instead of glulx assembler. It's (C) Yokiyoki and Carlos Sanchez and
it's released under the GPL license.

The jsl libraries all can be used in your games, so they all use the more flexible
