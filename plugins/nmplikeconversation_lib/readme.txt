This plugin allows creation of menu guided conversations like with the old interactive fiction engine NMP. For the time being there is no documentation, 
but the code includes the CONV condact (CONV convno flagno), the INCLUDE and EXCLUDE condacts (activate/deactivate a given sentence in menus by number) 
and the base library "conv_nmplike_lib". Also, the file conv4.jsp is included, being a sample of a conversation (that must be programmed using javascript).
